The robot invasion started while you were working your job at the ammo factory. Luckily, you brought your lazer pistol to work!

Out-run and out-gun the robots then destroy their portals to stop them from spawning. Look out for ammo boxes, health packs and even more powerful guns.

Sharp-Shooter is a first-person-shooter game made in Unity following [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) with extra levels, enemies and polish added by me. 

Releasing when its done.
